Last name means "[[Water|The ocean]]"

Goes to bed early on Saturday for early mass^[sacrament] ([[BMU.pdf#page=27|Page 15]])

Suggests that [[Cháves]] stay back (possibly because he is too emotional)

Voice of reason along with [[Narciso]]

Does not believe in religion
Beat up a priest for demeaning one of his ancestors
Called priests "women"

Fine breaking fast before communion (same as [[Ultima]])

## Dream 
[[BMU.pdf#page=26|Page 14]]

Gather his sons and move westward to California

Bitter because the war took his sons ([[León]], [[Andrew]], and [[Eugene]])

Loves sharing it, and is glad [[Ultima]] is there so he can share it with her

Cries because war ruined his dream ([[BMU.pdf#page=27|Page 15]])
