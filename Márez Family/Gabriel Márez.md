## Dream 
[Page 14](</BMU.pdf#page=26>)

Gather his sons and move westward to California

Bitter because the war took his sons ([León](</Márez Family/León.md>), [Andrew](</Márez Family/Andrew.md>), and [Eugene](</Márez Family/Eugene.md>))

Loves sharing it, and is glad [Ultima](</Ultima.md>) is there so he can share it with her
