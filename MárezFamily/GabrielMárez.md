Last name means "[[Water|The ocean]]"

Goes to bed early on Saturday for early mass^[sacrament] ([[BMU.pdf#page=27|Page 15]])

Suggests that [Cháves](</Cháves.md>) stay back (possibly because he is too emotional)

Voice of reason along with [Narciso](</Narciso.md>)

Does not believe in religion
Beat up a priest for demeaning one of his ancestors
Called priests "women"

Fine breaking fast before communion (same as [Ultima](</Ultima.md>))

## Dream 
[[BMU.pdf#page=26|Page 14]]

Gather his sons and move westward to California

Bitter because the war took his sons ([León](</MárezFamily/León.md>), [Andrew](</MárezFamily/Andrew.md>), and [Eugene](</MárezFamily/Eugene.md>))

Loves sharing it, and is glad [Ultima](</Ultima.md>) is there so he can share it with her

Cries because war ruined his dream ([[BMU.pdf#page=27|Page 15]])
