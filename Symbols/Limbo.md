## Literal
**Roman Catholic theology**

**The border place between heaven and hell**
	- not condemned to punishment
	- deprived 
		- the joy of eternal existence with God
		- heaven

**Two kinds**
	- *limbus patrum* ("father's limbo")
		- Also called Limbo of Patriarchs and *Sheol* (Judaism equivalent)
		- where the Old Testament saints were confined

## Interpretation
Because the [[the Virgin]] could not redeem the children from Limbo, it shows the limitation of religion

[[The Owl|The owl]] saves them instead, though I do not know what this means.

The actions of the owl please [[the Virgin]], showing the limitations of religion
