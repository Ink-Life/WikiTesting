[Antonio Márez](</MárezFamily/AntonioMárez.md>) flies over the *Llano*^[desert] until landing at *Las Pasturas*^[The main setting/village of the novel]

He witnesses his birth.

An "[old woman in black](</Ultima.md>)" helps deliver the baby

She wraps [Antonio](</MárezFamily/AntonioMárez.md>) and cleans the bed

Ultima places the "useless cord"[^chord] and "[afterbirth](</Symbols/afterbirth.md>)"^[items expelled after birth; the placenta and fetal membranes] at the feet of *[the Virgin](</Symbols/theVirgin.md>)*

[Maria](</MárezFamily/GabrielandMariaMárez.md#Maria Márez>)'s brothers (from *[La Puerto de Los Lunas](</LaPuerto.md>)*^[The port of the night]) arrive with gifts

"This one^[Antonio] will be a *Luna* \[. . .\] a farmer and keep our traditions. Perhaps God will bless our family and make the baby a priest"

As a show of hope they rubbed dirt on the babe's forehead and surrounded the bed with "the fruits of their harvest"^[specifically fresh green chile and corn, ripe apples and peaches, pumpkins and green beans]

#contrast: Contrasting the reverent *Lunas*, the *Márez*^[[Gabriel](</MárezFamily/GabrielandMariaMárez.md#Gabriel Márez>)'s brothers] enter on horseback with guns firing. They are also described laughing, singing, and drinking.
#symbol: "as restless as the [seas](</Symbols/Water.md>)"

They shouted that Antonio will be a fine *vaquero*^[cowboy], smashing the fruit and replacing with
- A saddle
- horse blankets
- bottles of whiskey
- a new rope
- bridles
- *chapas*^[chaps]
- an old guitar

#symbol: The *Márez* rubbed off the dirt as "man was not to be tied to the earth but free upon it"

#symbol: the [afterbirth](</Symbols/afterbirth.md>) and "the chord that once linked him to eternity"[^chord] represent [Antonio](</MárezFamily/AntonioMárez.md>)'s destiny

The two families each want to take the [afterbirth](</Symbols/afterbirth.md>) to seal [Antonio](</MárezFamily/AntonioMárez.md>)'s destiny as a farmer (*Lunas*) or *conquistadores* (*Márez*), and they prepare for battle

[Ultima](</Ultima.md>) stops the fight by burying the [afterbirth](</Symbols/afterbirth.md>) herself, so only she will know his destiny

[^chord]: Umbilical chord
