The brothers act similar to how the Trinity^[A Christian theology (not universally accepted) where Jesus, God, and The Holy Spirit are one person with three identities] is described

The soul of [the river](</Symbols/Water.md>) goes to steal the souls of the brothers and they cry out in fear, they think it is *[La llorona](</Symbols/Water.md>)* or [Lupito](</Lupito.md>)
> [!quote] [León](</MárezFamily/León.md>), [Andrew](</MárezFamily/Andrew.md>), and [Eugene](</MárezFamily/Eugene.md>)

[Antonio](</MárezFamily/AntonioMárez.md>) corrects them (it is the soul of [the river](</Symbols/Water.md>)), throws on the cloak of [[Gabriel and Maria Márez#Maria Márez#Dream|the priest]] and pleads with [the river](</Symbols/Water.md>) to let the brothers pass to build our [[Gabriel and Maria Márez#Gabriel Márez#Dream|castle on the hill]]

[Maria Márez](</MárezFamily/GabrielandMariaMárez.md#Maria Márez>) cries as [her son](</MárezFamily/AntonioMárez.md>) grows old
